## Description
The book is an introductory course on formal semantics written in Portuguese. The material grew out of class notes that I made for courses that have been taught on several occasions and places in Brazil since 2004. The book does not presuppose any knowledge about formal approaches to meaning, nor any background on logic or mathematics. It can be used as a one-semester course for upper-level undergraduate or by beginning graduate students. All chapters end with suggested readings and exercises, making it also suitable for self-learners. The book is divided into 7 chapters. Starting with an introductory chapter on the basics of truth-conditional semantics and formal approaches to meaning, the core of the book covers the semantic ''operations'' of saturation/predication,  coordination/negation, nominal reference, modification, quantification, and binding.
